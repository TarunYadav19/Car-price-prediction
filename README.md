# Car-price-prediction
Car Price Prediction using Spark and MongoDB involves developing a predictive model to estimate car prices. By leveraging the distributed computing capabilities of Spark and the flexibility of MongoDB, the project aims to analyze car data, perform data preprocessing, implement machine learning algorithms, and predict car prices based on factors such as features, specifications, and historical pricing information. The goal is to create an accurate and scalable solution for predicting car prices using a combination of Spark and MongoDB technologies.
